# NACA-0012-Airfoil-CFD-Study-at-0-and-5-AOA
CFD simulation of laminar flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil using ANSYS Fluent. Drag and lift coefficients are analyzed at 0° and 5° angles of attack. Includes domain setup, mesh generation, boundary conditions, contour plots, and physics-based analysis with comparison to literature data. Here is the problem statement:-
